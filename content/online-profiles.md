Summary: Your TELUS email gives you access to these team tools

Now that you have your email set-up, give it and your xid to your mother-hen. With access granted, use your Telus email to create profiles on:

- Slack
- Trello
- Taiga
- AWS
- Omniture

We are working on getting access to codeschool as well!

GitHub
------------------

Once mother-hen gives you access, we have a [gem](https://github.com/colstrom/git-ready "") for forking and cloning all the repos.

You may also need access to BitBucket.
