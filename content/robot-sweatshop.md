Summary: How to use Robot-sweatshop

# Robot Sweatshop

First, [read all of the README](https://github.com/JScott/robot_sweatshop/blob/master/README.md). I'll wait.

Robot Sweatshop does 2 things: let you define a series of commands to run and listen for POST commands to start them. This makes it a great tool for automating the running of scripts. Some great use cases include: running and reporting on tests, building and deploying code, and replacing Jenkins.
