Summary: Run-down of each meeting and how you can participate

You will also receive calendar invites for all these, but here is a run down of what happens during each. Participate! It helps get into the work-flow so much quicker!!!

###Morning Standup
Everyone on the devops team lists what we accomplished yesterday, what we will work on today, possible road-blocks to achieving what we hope to, and then hand off to the next person. This is quick, meant to keep us all on the same page while maintaining autonomy. 

###Pull Request
Right after Standup we run through pull requests, discuss, comment, and merge. The rule is: _you don't merge your own code!_

###Tuesday Dev Meeting
We have a lot of people on our floor as well as teams in Toronto. There is a Trello board with all the points to be discussed. Feel free to add points and also speak up during the meeting.

###Sprint Review
This is meant for stakeholders to be able to know what we are accomplishing. We use Taiga and talk about what we've done by addressing each card in our current sprint. Completed are marked as such and those that still need work are bumped to our next sprint. 

###Retrospective
We have 15 min of silent time to write out what we found Positive, Negative, and Neutral about what happened in the past week. Then we copy those over to Trello as cards. They are organized and discussed. Pick a sticker and use your three votes on whatever card in the Negative column. The top three are made into stories for our next sprint.

###Planning Poker
Deciding on what we can accomplish for our next sprint. Using t-shirt sizes (XS-L) we vote on complexity of a issue rather than time to finish.

###Bonus!
- We get fed lunch on Wednesday. woot! woot!
- Friday Lunch & Learn. Pretty self-explanatory. At the Tuesday dev meetings you can nominate yourself to speak on any topic if you so wish. Ask mother-hen and you can probably bring in an outside speaker if you so desire.
