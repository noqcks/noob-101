Summary: How to set up your new email

This can be somewhat of a pain, but you need it, apologies in advance.

### Step 1
Open Outlook and go to Preferences, Add Account
Click Exchange.

### Step 2
Fill in form accordingly:
Account Description => Telus
Full Name => Your name as per on your print-out
Email Address => Your telus.com email
Method => Username and Password
User name => TELUS\your xid
Password => See your print-out

Hopefully it works first-time(*fingers-crossed*). NOTE: For your username "TELUS\" _must be in front of your xid_ .

### Step 3
Open System Preferences,Internet Accounts
Click on Exchange

### Step 4
Fill in form accordingly:
Name => Your name
Email Address => Your telus email
Password => See your print-out

Hit Continue (you might need to brute force this a bit)
In the past, the password needed to be reset. Ask your mother-hen.

### Step 5
Fill in form accordingly:
User Name => TELUS\your xid
Password => See your print-out
Server Address => mail.telus.com

Hopefully you are now all set up! If you want to be able to access your email account outside of the corpnet, you will need to request a TAS token.
