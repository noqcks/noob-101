<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/webchannel/webchannel-ci/src">A Bitbucket repository</a>. There are a few major sections of code in it: email, log, project-specific, and old. There's also example data in the <code>test_data</code> path.</p>
<p>Most things in here should probably be pulled out into a gem or something? It seems awkward to rely on a magic repo being pulled down and used. There's also a lot of cleaning up and refactoring that could be done.</p>
<p>Apologies for everything being so messy D:</p>
<h3>email (deprecated)</h3>
<p>Scripts to email test results to the commit author. May or may not still work? Utilizes Amazon SES and thus requires credentials to be filled on deployment.</p>
<p><code>log/reset-human-readable-log.rb</code> is a big part of this as well. It helps to aggregate results for the email. This could be handled a lot better though than some magic script.</p>
<h3>log</h3>
<p>Scripts to parse results files and log them to Centralized Logging. For example, <code>log/phpunit.rb results_directory</code> will use the class in <code>lib/phpunit_parser.rb</code> to pick apart the results and errors file from PHPUnit and send them ElasticSearch and InfluxDB.</p>
<h3>project-specific</h3>
<p>The idea of this was scripts that were unique to individual projects. This is actually a bad idea and makes things very opaque at the playbook level. The correct solution would be to pull all of this out and call the appropriate commands inside a Robot Sweatshop job instead. Much more transparent.</p>
<h3>old</h3>
<p>This contains old scripts that need updating.</p>
<h4>archive</h4>
<p>Take the results and the code it was run on and dump it into a Git repo as a snapshot artifact of what was run. This is a good idea that no one used so I took it out to reduce complexity. It's also very close to what already happens for the deployment process so seemed potentially redundant.</p>
<h4>parsing</h4>
<ul>
<li>TotalValidator, an accessibility tool</li>
<li>PHPUnit coverage, a PHPUnit result that Rob refused to run because USS code was so broken that it fatally errored out &gt;:|</li>
</ul>
<h2>How is it used?</h2>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/telusdigital/playbook-uss-consumer/blob/master/build/playbook.yml">USS Consumer Build server playbook</a> to see it in action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the code</li>
<li>Test the code</li>
<li>Reset the results aggregate</li>
<li>Log the PHPUnit results</li>
<li>Log the Git commit data</li>
<li>Send an email of the results aggregate</li>
</ul>
<p>It's that easy!</p>
